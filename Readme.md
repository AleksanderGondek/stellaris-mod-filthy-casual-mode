[This mod](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=741819051) goal is to make game significantly easier by adding edicts (usable only by human player) which grant various benefits to the empire at no maintenance costs.

All credit for the idea goes to “Easy Mode” mod, which sadly seems to be abandoned.
