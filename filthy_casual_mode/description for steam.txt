Creates an edict called "Blessing of Omnissiah" that gives player all benefits shown on image. This blessing has zero-cost upkeep and will never be picked up by AI player.

Mod was inspired on "Easy Mode", which sadly seems no longer to be updated.

Note: I am currently quite occupied with my job, so expect that promised revamp of this mod will come later than sooner (ETA: after Christmas).
What can be expected of said revamp: Removal of buffs no longer used by game mechanics, ability to customize a bit power of buffs, bit more better process of updating.
