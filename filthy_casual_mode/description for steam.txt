Adds seven different polices, which grants player various benefits, as well as the ability to control the strength of the advantage gained. All polices have zero-cost upkeep and will never be picked up by AI players.
Additionally, the mod allows for each policy to be changed at-will, which should yield a much better experience while testing-out different approaches. 

List of introduces policies:
[list]
    [*]Blessing of Ares - Increases army morale, naval capacity, ships building speed and reduces army upkeep
    [*]Blessing of Dionysus - Increases insult efficiency, trade attractiveness and trust growth
    [*]Blessing of Eunomia - Increases population happiness, trade attractiveness, sector cap and leader cap
    [*]Blessing of Hephaestus - Decreases and improves overall buidling speed
    [*]Blessing of Hermes - Increases ships speed
    [*]Blessing of Midas - Increases any resource gains
    [*]Blessing of Omnissiah - Increases research speed
[/list]
