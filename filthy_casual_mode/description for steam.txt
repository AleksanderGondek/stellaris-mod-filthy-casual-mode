Adds four different edicts, which grants player various benefits. All of those edicts have zero-cost upkeep and will never be picked up by AI players.

The most significant edict is called "Blessing of Omnissiah" which grants huge boots to every aspect of the game (see screenshot).

For players that wish more targeted (or temporary) increases, 3 other edicts are included:
[list]
    [*]Blessing of Gandhi - improves population happiness, both in war and at peace.
    [*]Blessing of Midas - boosts resources output rate from tiles.
    [*]Blessing of Tesla - greatly speeds up research.
[/list]

Mod was inspired on "Easy Mode", which sadly seems no longer to be updated.

[u][b]Please notice[/b]: I have not yet added/adjusted any in-game modifiers that may have changed.[/u]
I will need time to do so - for now I have made sure to make the mod playable again.
